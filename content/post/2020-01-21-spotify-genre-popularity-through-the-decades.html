<p>This dataset was taken from the very popular <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">TidyTuesday</a> github repo, and this was my attempt at having a go at visualization given my love for music and this was a Spotify dataset.</p>
<p>Datasets from TidyTuesday are usually cleaned (or at least there’ll be instructions/hints on what one should first start with), and I begin by importing the data and wrangling it slightly by labelling the decades.</p>
<p>In the spirit of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">Perfect is the enemy of good</a>”, this will be a short post aimed at answering just a couple of questions with EDA and visualization.</p>

<p>Using track popularity as a gauge, how have subgenres evolved over the decades?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spotify %&gt;%

<p>Permanent wave stood out to me as a rock sub-genre that, until 2010, stood the test of time in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>But as an avid music fan, I’ve not heard of permanent wave at all! Digging into the dataset a little more … permanent wave actually had a few of my all-time favourite artists!</p>

  filter(playlist_subgenre == &quot;permanent wave&quot;) %&gt;%
