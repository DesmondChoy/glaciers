<p>My career in the investment industry began in 2011 with a portfolio management role in a Fund of Hedge Funds and subsequently with a regional life insurer. In my current capacity, I focus on fundamental bottom-up research on corporate bonds in a regional asset management firm based in Singapore, and have been a CFA Charterholder since 2014.</p>
<p>Having discovered R in 2018, I very quickly fell in love with the language, packages and community - and have been applying data science to make data-driven investment decisions. I also collaborate with data scientists to build, train and evaluate machine learning models.</p>
<p>I’m familiar with classical &amp; modern machine learning algorithms (supervised &amp; unsupervised) with a fair understanding of descriptive statistics. I plan on dedicating future blog posts to document my learning journey of applied ML as well as all things data science-related.</p>
