      <description>This dataset was taken from the very popular TidyTuesday github repo, and this was my attempt at having a go at visualization given my love for music and this was a Spotify dataset.
In the spirit of “Perfect is the enemy of good”, this will be a short post aimed at answering just a couple of questions with EDA and visualization.
Datasets from TidyTuesday are usually cleaned (or at least there’ll be instructions/hints on what one should first start with), and I begin by importing the data and exploring it via skimr.</description>
