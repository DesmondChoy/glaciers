      <description>Coffee quality-related data is explored and cleaned. Using the tidymodels framework, I demonstrate feature engineering, fitting of three models (LASSO, Random Forest and XGBoost), tuning of hyperparameters and analyzing out-of-sample performance.</description>

      <description>The FIFA20 player dataset is visualized using ridgeline plots and network graphs. Unsupervised machine learning (Principal Components Analysis) is also used to generate a new set of statistically independent features.</description>

      <title>Hip-Hop Lyrics Be Flowing with Tidy Text Mining</title>
      <link>/2020/05/hip-hop-lyrics-be-flowin-with-tidy-text-mining/</link>

      <guid>/2020/05/hip-hop-lyrics-be-flowin-with-tidy-text-mining/</guid>
      <description>Hip-hop songs&amp;rsquo; sentiment is extracted and visualized. Regularized regression is then trained on lyrics to predict if a hip-hop song was old school (released before the year 2000) or modern.</description>

      <title>Food Consumption and CO2 Emissions</title>

      <description>This will be my first attempt at machine learning using the tidymodels package, with a dataset taken from TidyTuesday. The code used to scrape this data can be found here.
The study analyses data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to determine the quantity of produce supplied for consumption of 11 food types for all countries researched. Using CO2 emissions data, the carbon footprint per capita is then calculated for each food type.</description>
