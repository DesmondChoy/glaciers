      <description>The FIFA20 player dataset is visualized using ridgeline plots and network graphs. Unsupervised machine learning (Principal Components Analysis) is also used to generate a new set of statistically independent features.</description>

      <title>Hip-Hop Lyrics Be Flowing with Tidy Text Mining</title>

      <description>Iâ€™ve been hit with a double dose of NLP inspiration after reading a recent Julia Silge blog post and watching a Datacamp video on Tidy Text Mining which she used to teach. Ergo, this post will set out to do two things: use sentiment analysis to explore hip-hop songs, and subsequently use the tidymodels package on the lyrics to predict which era (Old School versus Modern) the songs came from.</description>

      <title>Food Consumption and CO2 Emissions</title>

      <description>This will be my first attempt at machine learning using the tidymodels package, with a dataset taken from TidyTuesday. The code used to scrape this data can be found here.
The study analyses data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to determine the quantity of produce supplied for consumption of 11 food types for all countries researched. Using CO2 emissions data, the carbon footprint per capita is then calculated for each food type.</description>
