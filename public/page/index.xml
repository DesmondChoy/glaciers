      <description>I have been working in the investment industry since 2011, previously with a Fund of Hedge Funds, and subsequently with a regional life insurer. In my current capacity, I primarily perform fundamental bottoms-up research on corporate bonds and contribute to investment ideas in a regional asset management firm based in Singapore.
