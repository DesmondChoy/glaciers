# Glaciers (https://desmondchoy.netlify.app/)

Having discovered R in 2018, I very quickly fell in love with the language, packages and community - and am currently applying data science techniques to make impactful, value-added business decisions.   

I would describe myself as being passionate about data, fascinated by NLP, constantly curious and pushing boundaries. 

This blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, using the Tranquilpeak theme and deployed using Netlify. I use this blog to showcase new libraries, explore unusual data sets and learn new data science techniques.
