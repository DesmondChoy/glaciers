Having discovered R in 2018, I very quickly fell in love with the language, packages and community - and have been applying data science to make data-driven investment decisions. 
I would describe myself as passionate about data, fascinated by NLP, constantly curious and pushing boundaries. 

This blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, using the Tranquilpeak theme and deployed using Netlify. 
All code to my blog posts can be found in my Github.
